Title: CALCULATING PLACEMENT OF EYELETS FOR LACING HISTORIC CLOTHING

Description: Accompanies the instructions in "The Zen of Spiral Lacing" 
by providing the measurements for the placement of eyelets, 
dependent on the length of the opening and the number of laces desired.

How to Run: Open the command prompt, by going to the start menu and typing "cmd" + Enter
In the black window, type "cd" (for "change directory), and then paste the file location for the folder in which the file is saved.
Type "python eyelets.py" + Enter to run the program.
The program works for any unit of measurement. Provided the numbers you enter are all in the same unit, the result will be in the same unit.
