# Eyelets

Calculates measurements for correct placement of eyelets for lacing historic clothing, based on length of the opening and number of laces desired.

For my mum who makes things.

## Usage

[Clone the project](https://github.com/Charlotte-ER/eyelets.git), then run it as follows:

```bash
python eyelets.py
```

The program will ask questions about the opening in the garment, and your preference for the placement of the laces. For each question, type your answers into the terminal and hit enter.

The output consists of written instructions and a diagram.
